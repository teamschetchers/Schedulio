Software Development Project
 
 An appointment reservation and waiting list live software could be a useful tool for various businesses such as salons, spas, clinics, or medical offices. Here are some features the software could have:
	1.	User-friendly interface for making and cancelling appointments online
	2.	Real-time availability updates/notifications for scheduling appointments
	3.	//Option for clients to join a waiting list in case of fully booked appointments//
	4.	Automated email or text reminders to clients before their appointments
	5.	//Integration with calendars and scheduling software//
	6.	//Ability to manage and prioritize the waiting list//
	7.	Option for staff to add walk-in appointments or update appointment status
	8.	//Reporting and analytics features for tracking appointment trends and revenue//
	9.	Option for clients to rate their experience and provide feedback.

## How It Works

1	Integration with the business's calendar: The platform integrates with the business's calendar system to show real-time availability for appointments.
	2	Booking process: Customers can choose the date and time they want to book an appointment, and the platform automatically reserves that time slot for them.
	3	// Payment processing: Depending on the business, customers may be able to pay for their appointment through the platform, or the payment may be processed at the time of the appointment. // (Future Feature)
	4	Confirmations and reminders: The platform will send customers a confirmation of their booking and reminders about their appointment, to reduce the risk of no-shows.
	5	// Waiting list: If all appointment slots are taken, customers can choose to join a waiting list. The platform will automatically notify them if a slot becomes available. // (Future Feature)
	6	//Management and analytics: Business owners and staff can access the platform to manage appointments, view analytics and reports, and update their availability.// (Future Feature)
The platform should be designed to be scalable and flexible, so it can be used by businesses of all sizes, in a variety of industries, including healthcare, hospitality, and personal services. The goal is to provide a seamless and efficient way for customers to book appointments, while saving business owners time and resources.


Why is Schedulio necessary?

An online reservation platform can be a valuable tool for businesses that require appointment scheduling, payment processing, and customer management capabilities. It can make it easier for customers to book appointments, and for businesses to manage their schedule, and customer data.
Whether or not an online reservation platform is necessary will depend on the specific needs of each business and its customers. For businesses that receive a high volume of appointments, an online platform can make appointment scheduling and payment processing more efficient and convenient. For businesses that operate in a highly competitive market, an online platform can help them stand out and differentiate themselves from competitors.



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
